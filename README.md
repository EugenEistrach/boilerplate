## Project Structure

- `/src/app`: Main application code (Next.js App Router)
  - `/(marketing)`: Public marketing pages
  - `/workspace`: Protected app area
  - `/onboarding`: User onboarding process
- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/src/db`: Database configuration and schema
- `/src/lib`: Utility functions and configurations

## Feature Organization

Each feature in the boilerplate is typically organized as follows:

- `/src/app/workspace/[feature-name]/`: Main directory for the feature
  - `ui/`: Subdirectory for feature-specific UI components
  - `page.tsx`: Main page component for the feature
  - `*-tables.ts`: Database schema definitions
  - `*-queries.tsx`: Database queries and data access functions
  - `*-actions.ts`: Server actions for API calls
  - `*-validations.ts`: Zod schemas for input validation
  - `*-types.ts`: Type definitions for the feature
  - `*-jobs.ts`: Cron jobs related to the feature (if applicable)

This structure promotes modularity and makes it easy to add, modify, or remove features while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

Main features include:
- User management: `/src/app/workspace/user/`
- Cron jobs: `/src/app/workspace/cronjobs/`

Example features include:
- Notes: `/src/app/workspace/notes/`
